# Changelog

All notable changes to UltiDash are documented here.

## v0.1 — 2026-05-30

First release. **Experimental — still under testing in the field.**

### Added
- Full-screen LVGL flight dashboard built on **HeliDash** (base) with:
  - In-widget **top bar**: date/time + radio (TX) battery icon (voltage + %, red below
    warning threshold) — replaces the EdgeTX top bar.
  - **Center battery gauge** with the **ePowerbar** reserve/fuel model: reserve-adjusted
    fuel %, discrete green/yellow/red colors, cell count (`NS`), big % and used mAh,
    startup cell-check (grey progress + warning if not full).
  - **Left status panel**: model image (**eBitmap** style), total flights & flight time,
    Governor + Throttle, **eStatus** ESC fault decoder (YGE/OpenYGE, Scorpion, HobbyWing,
    FLYROTOR, OMP, BLHeli_32) + arming-disable reasons, Profile / Rate / Battery-Profile.
  - **Right values panel**: cell/battery voltage, headspeed, current, ESC temp, BEC.
  - **Statistics view** (auto on disarmed/disconnected): Actual/Min/Max table, total
    flights & total flight time (Rotorflight MSP), capacity used.
  - Compact radio-battery icon style adapted from **BattAnalog**.
- **Callouts**: fuel %, low/critical cell voltage, armed/disarm, and ELRS
  link-quality / telemetry-lost warnings (armed only, configurable via `LinkWarn`,
  `RQlyWarn`, `RQlyCrit`).
- Flight-time tracking made governor-independent (headspeed-based) and run in the
  background so it counts off-screen too.
- `Skp` (skipped-telemetry-packet counter) shown in the bottom status bars.

### Notes
- MSP is only read on connect/disarm — never during armed flight.
- No external libraries (no eLib); UltiDash loads only its own files.
- Licensing: GPLv3 intended; the unlicensed HeliDash base must be clarified before a
  formal public release — see [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).
